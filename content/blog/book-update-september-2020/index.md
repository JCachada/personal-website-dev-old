First things first: this update is quite late, but there's a good reason for it. I had surgery this month (everything went well and I'm mostly recovered), which put a dent in my plans and timelines. Still, I wanted to do the monthly update anyway, which means I only had time to do it right as the month was ending. Next month things should return to normality, seeing as there's no other surgeries or setbacks planned.

Because of the above, this month will have no game update; I simply didn't work on it enough to warrant a post.

I did, however, manage to work on the book a fair deal, and I had to chance to think about what it means to find your voice as a writer. That is the topic of today's post. As usual, if you're mostly interested in the word count update, scroll to the bottom of this page.

## Stealing from the greats

A question I come across very often on writing forums and conversations with aspiring writers manifests itself in some variation of: "Can I write about Y? This famous author already wrote a book that has the same concept." 

I've never quite understood that concern. Imagine someone telling you that they didn't want to watch *1984* because they've seen *A Clockwork Orange* once. Or saying they don't want to play *Mass Effect* because they already played *Dragon Age*, and they follow very similar tropes in different settings. 

The reality of it is that concepts are worth very little in writing, and the execution is impossible to steal. Sure, there are a million space operas out there, and yours might not even be particularly interesting to a general audience, but it'll be yours. No one can write the space opera you would write except you. So why not write it, and see what comes out of it? 

There's also the issue that original concepts are extremely hard to come by. A great comparative literature researcher said once that originality died with Shakespeare, and everyone that came afterward was just retelling similar stories in different ways. In Philosophy, we sometimes say it died with Aristotle. 

Really, originality is fine and well. Yeah, maybe *Game of Thrones* isn't that different from five other niche books most people haven't heard about. So what? Can you imagine if George R.R. Martin didn't write it because it wasn't original enough? A large part of Neil Gaiman's body of work is retelling old myths in his own, unique way. Can you imagine being deprived of *American Gods* because someone already wrote modern-day retellings of *Odin* once? Or because American travel novels exist? 

In the course of writing my book, not once did I think about the originality of my concept. The central idea for the magic system is born out of a twist on Mistborn's, a *what if* that popped into my mind as I read it. One of the central points of conflict comes from one of Gaiman's books, where I read something he wrote and went "oh, that's cool. I'd like to try and do that." And one of the primary sidekicks in the book comes straight from *The Luminaries*, which isn't even a fantasy novel! 

Stephen King often says that the first step to becoming a good writer is to read a lot, and read a lot of different things, often outside your comfort zone. That isn't just because it's good for your brain and it gives you perspective on what's being done in writing today; it's also because it gives you a good idea of who to steal from. You can't take inspiration from other people without knowing what they're doing. 

One of the things I do, as I read throughout the year, is that I keep a notepad full of passages I enjoy reading, that I think work very well to elicit a specific mood, or that I just like for some odd reason. I jot down these passages over the year with no indication of what book, author, or series they belong to. After a while, I've got a good collection of them; and chances are that, when I'm struggling to find a way to describe a scene or to set the mood for something, I'll be able to look in my little notepad and find a passage that works at doing what I want to do, or at the very least that inspires a mood in me. Then I get to adapt it to my book and try to put my spin on it. 

Another thing I do is that, when I'm stuck on something, I explicitly go and look for books that I think do it well. Pat Rothfuss taught me this: I saw an interview of his once where he mentioned how he was awful at writing fighting scenes and had no idea where to even begin. So he picked up some William Gibson and tried to figure out how the fighting scenes were written in his books, and why it was they worked. He then realized Gibson never actually described any fighting in his fight scenes; the prose was more akin to dancing, a tug-of-war of the mind that also sometimes mentioned swords. He copied that technique and used it in *The Wise Man's Fear*. 

I think that's a brilliant way of doing things. If I don't know how to set the eerie mood for a particular scene, why not pick up some Lovecraft and try and figure out why he did it? In code, if I don't know how to do something, I find someone who does, and I see how they're doing it, then try to do better. Why should writing be any different? 

Of course, this doesn't mean you should blatantly copy other authors' work. Using them to learn is fine, plagiarizing is not. Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, and any writer, at their heart, is nothing but the combination of the art he's been exposed to in his life, with his spin and personality thrown on top of it. But that's the key aspect of it: it has to be yours. 

My writing voice, if you could hear it, would have to contain a lot of different ones. From Hemingway and Don DeLillo to Sapkowski and Gaiman. And I think my writing is all the better for it.

## Like a child

I will, however, admit that I am too impressionable. Because of that, when doing revisions, I have to be careful with what I'm reading. Often I won't read anything at all during the revision process, and when I do it'll be non-fiction. This is because I'll often find my writing voice changing to match the type of sentence construction, prose style, and overall themes of whatever book I'm reading at the moment. This can cause the end product to be a mash of different styles, where I sound like Hemingway, terse and to the point, for the first 5 chapters, then I pick up Martin and become gratuitously purple for the next 5. 

As sad as it is, not reading at all during the revision process helps me keep a coherent voice that I know is my own; and gives me a good excuse to read extra for the rest of the year, to make up for it.

## Current state of things

Despite having surgery, I have hit the goal I set for myself last month. As the end of the year approaches, it's time to build up the crunch a bit to make sure I stick to the goal of having the book done by the end of the year. 

**Current word count**: 33.751
**October goal**: 50.000 words on the second draft.
