I am glad to say I am done with the first draft of the book. It took me longer than I expected it to (perhaps my predictions are a bit optimistic), but it is done. I am glad with what I came up with and have started a second passthrough and first revision.

While my first draft was all about getting the story on paper and making sure I had it all vomited out, the second draft requires a bit more finesse. As I finished my first draft, I was immediately afforded with a lot of clarity. Now that I had a full, bird's eye view of the story that I wanted to tell, it was easier to look at the individual chapters and scenes and realize things that didn't fit or that needed to be changed. Throughout the process of writing the first draft I also kept a journal of every thing that I noticed as I went along and wanted to mark as "review this later". This was a way to shut up my inner editor for long enough that I could actually get anything done. But now that I'm done with the first draft, it's time to address these concerns - so, besides adjusting some plot points, I'll also be reworking some scenes and massively improving the language, sentence construction, atmosphere... Really, everything about the novel.

I once heard a famous author (I want to say Neil Gaiman, but am not fully certain) say that the first draft was when you wrote, and the second draft was when you made it look like you had any idea what you were doing the first time around. The second draft is where the magic is going to happen, and I'm super excited to take the time to polish up my scenes and make them as good and immersive as I can. I've already started working on some dialogues in the first chapter and I think they're coming out a lot better this time around.

Another thing you might have noticed is that I've added a tentative title of **"The Life Collectors"** to the home page of the website. This is not a final title, I want to make that very clear. But I figured it was time I started thinking about it, and that it gave everything a bit more of a professional look if I removed "Untitled Book" from the homepage. Titles are hard for me to come up with, so I'm trying some and seeing how interesting they are and if any of them sticks until I'm done with the book. Maybe it'll be "The Life Collectors", but most likely the title will still change several times until I land on something. We'll see on the next update, I guess.

Thanks for keeping up with what I've been doing, and I hope I can get my work to you soon. I can't wait for you to read it.

## Current state of things

As it stands, I'm about 5 thousand words in and working on the second draft  as outlined above. Considering that I want to have this book finished this year, and that there's still a part of the process missing involving beta readers, I'm going to kick things up to eleven and set a goal for this month of revising at least 35, but ideally 40 thousand words of the first draft. This will take a lot of time if I want to make sure that the quality remains high, but it's a challenge I want to impose myself.

**Current word count**: 5 thousand words (second draft).
**June goal**: Revise 35 to 40 thousand words.
