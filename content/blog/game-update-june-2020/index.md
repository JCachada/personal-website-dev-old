This will unfortunately be a very short dev diary, and it'll serve only as an update as to what's been going on. 

As outlined in my latest Book Update, I've been making a lot of progress with the book and am trying to meet my personal goal of having it fully done this year. Like I said in my mission statement, the book will take precedence over the game until it is done. So, this month I got a lot of work done on the book, and not a lot of work done on the game. I started working on the proof of concept for sidescrolling combat, and implemented it (you can see it on github), but did not address any of the other possible gameplay mechanics. Hopefully I'll be able to make some progress on at least one of them this month.

I'll make a more detailed post on implementing basic sidescrolling combat soon, but for now this is all the updates on the state of the game for the month of June. If you were more interested in the game than in the book, I'm sorry, but I've always made it very clear that the book is my priority for now.

I hope to see you back again soon with more meaningful updates for the game's development!
