Let's get the cat out of the proverbial bag: the book is not done. The book will be done, I am not giving up on the book, but the idea that I would wrap it up by the end of 2021 turned out to be too ambitious. 

Actually, no, scratch that. It wasn't that it turned out to be too ambitious, it was that I ended up wanting to prioritize other things. 

Like I've said in other posts, I don't believe in writing about things that aren't meaningful to me. I can sit and force myself to write, and I have been doing exactly that; but unless I think I'm writing something worth reading about, I don't really consider it having written. 

With that said, writing is therapeutic for me. Throughout the year, I would often finish a hard day of work and decide I would force myself to write because obviously, I set a deadline for myself; only to then realize I actually was enjoying it, and to let it devolve into stream of consciousness, hilarious witch shanaenigans, or a ten page story about a duck trying to get down a river. Those are all great words that put me in a better mood and helped me survive the craziness. 

They are, however, not a part of the book. As much as those things were fun to write, and as much as some of them might be pretty fun to read (maybe I'll share them here one day, or put together some short stories after polishing them up), they're not part of the story I set out to tell with this book, and they don't exactly fit it. They also don't exactly fit the process of second drafting, which was meant to trim scenes I thought were unimportant and add some that I thought were important. They're not exactly lost time, but for this specific purpose of meeting this deadline, they might as well be. 

So that's why the book is late. I still think it's going to be a good book, but I can't tell you it's going to be a better book for this delay; all I can tell you is that for my own peace of mind and to maximize my mental health, that delay needed to happen.

The current state of it is not too bad, though. It's about 50.000 words into the second draft, which if you'll remember is a little over halfway through. And since the current plan is still to finish this second draft, then give it a proper prose polishing run, and finally give it to beta-readers... the whole process is, I would say, also a little past the halfway mark. I can't wait to eventually have this out there; I really do feel like there's some good stuff there.

## Have a good 2022!

I also want to take a little moment to wish you all an excellent 2022. 2021 was hard for a lot of us - at times, me included - and I really do hope you find peace, prosperity, kindness, and meaning in this coming year.

I hope to see you all soon!
