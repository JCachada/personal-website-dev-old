It's been a fair while since the last book update. I'd like to say "hey, the book's ready, and I just stopped writing these updates because I wanted to get it done as soon as possible." Unfortunately, that isn't what happened.

I don't want to go too deeply into why I haven't posted an update in a while. In short, life happened. My stepfather became physically violent and I had to deal with that, which meant a lot of added strife in dealing with my mother and my younger brother. I removed myself from that situation, and I'm currently in the process of buying an apartment because of it. And there's a massive pandemic raging that's got everyone a little bit on edge. The pandemic I'd grown used to dealing with, but everything else got the better of me and made the updates stop for a little while. You can see that I played through and wrote a detailed Cyberpunk 2077 review in that time, so it wasn't as much that I didn't have the time to write, but more that I didn't really have the heart to share. I felt like with everything happening around me I didn't have the mental energy to progress as quickly as I wanted to, and consuming art is much less demanding than trying to make it (and the same is true of writing about someone else's art). While I never stopped working on the book, I couldn't exactly come up with a good reason for why I wasn't making enough progress besides "yeah, shit happened, I need some time", and that didn't seem like a good enough reason to me. In retrospect, it would've been better than stopping updates altogether.

I plan on returning to regular updates now that things have calmed down a bit.

The updates took a hiatus: work on the book, however, didn't, so let's get back into it. We'll start with a simple, short update for this month and go from there. For the March update I'll consider writing a deeper blog post. I don't want to spend too much time and energy coming up with lessons or content for blog posts while working on the book, so while I'll write one of if there's a topic I want to cover, there's also the chance I'll just update you guys on the word count and the progress for that month. This should give me the most time to actually work on the book, as well as give me some leeway with commitments to make sure I don't get swamped.

Thank you for being interested, and I promise I won't be gone nearly as long this time around.

## Current state of things

**Current word count**: 53.130
