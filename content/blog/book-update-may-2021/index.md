Writing is hard.

Now that we got the monthly platitude out of the way, let's get on with the actual post.

Really, though, writing is *hard*, and the hardest part about it is that it isn't clear *what* exactly about it is hard. This is where tech (and other STEM endeavors) are a lot comfier. When I was learning code, I was often lost as to *how* I should do what I was attempting to do, but I often had a clear picture of *what* it was that I wanted to do. Writing, on the other hand, is often more like trying to create a web app before anyone has properly sat down to write the requirements. You end up questioning what you're actually doing, and not just the execution; would this be better as a crime novel? Man, I just saw a movie with an excellent romance - maybe introducing a similar plotline could help my story? What if I deleted the whole second act and replaced it with hot ninja demons? 

This is something I used to struggle a lot with when I started writing my first, never-see-the-light-of-day, oh-god-why-did-I-write-this, shitty novellas and short stories. In my hubris, I was actually pretty confident that I knew how I was supposed to write my stories; I just didn't know what stories I wanted to write. As a beginner, I also often thought that knowing what stories I wanted to write was absolutely vital to the success of the whole thing. If I wasn't writing about something that spoke to me, something that mattered, what was the point of writing to begin with? 

Nowadays, I think I was wrong on two counts. 

First, knowing *how* to write your stories is much harder than knowing what to write about. A lot of people have excellent ideas for stories pretty much constantly. I've consistently been amazed at the cool concepts I see other writers come up with, and at the sheer creativeness of the writing collective that we have access to nowadays. Seriously, you can just go on reddit.com/r/writingprompts any day of the week and find a pretty good, this-could-be-a-novel concept in not a lot of time.

Ideas, however, are a dime a dozen. And good writers are not just people who have good ideas. Sometimes they do, but I'd even go as far as to say that it's almost inconsequential. Good writers can write an interesting book about watching paint dry. 

Okay, maybe not quite. But really, good writers can make you care about the strangest things. Don't believe me? Think about *This American Life*, the legendary public radio show presented by Ira Glass. I have a hard time thinking of any one concept that has more potential to be a complete snooze fest. Do *you* feel compelled to hear slice of life tales about that one Democratic convention forty years ago? Or an assorted collection of unconnected stories about the economy as a whole? Maybe you're a weirdo and that sounds great to you, but I'm pretty sure most audiences would run away screaming and go read a magazine instead. 

*This American Life*, however, keeps being compelling pretty much every week. And that's not because it somehow manages to find the nuggets of "interesting" in those themes. They're not just good at finding compelling things about uncompelling subjects. It's that they're very good at *telling interesting stories*. And when you can tell interesting stories, you can tell them just about anything - even if you're not Stephen King coming up with cool concepts every time he goes for a walk.

The second thing I was wrong about was that I thought themes mattered a lot more than they do. 

Now, now, before you go call your former English teacher and give them my name and address so they can come teach me the ways of the Lord, hear me out. It's not that themes don't matter. It's that starting with them is a mistake.

Stories are about *connecting* with people. It's about your readers connecting with your story and, by the transitive property, you connecting with those readers. But for that to happen, there's another thing that needs to happen first - *you* need to connect with *your* story.

Of course you do, silly. Everyone knows that, you'll say.

You'd be surprised. If you've done any bit of writing yourself, you've probably thought at some point: "How will people react to this? How can I make it more appealing?"

Those aren't bad questions, especially if you're serious about getting published. The capitalist overlords do require some nasty research about things like demographics, target audiences, and other buzzwords that we like to sweep under the rug and pretend like they aren't a part of writing. They are, and they don't make writing any less pure for it. 

What I am saying, though, is that maybe that's not the question you should be asking all the time. And that most people, in fact, ask it way too much.

I think a much better question to start with is: "does this resonate with me?". Because if it doesn't, oh dear, it's probably not going to resonate with others.

Stephen King (ha, I bet you thought I was only namedropping him once), a criminally underrated author by critics who think genre fiction is somehow less *pure* than literary fiction, continues to sell millions of books and resonate deeply with people. He wrote an excellent book on the craft - it's called *On Writing*, and I recommend anyone who wants to write seriously give it a read. 

There was a specific lesson in that book that stuck with me over the years and that I feel solved a lot of the problems in my writing process. It shone light on things I didn't know were in the dark. It's a very simple lesson, in many ways probably an oversimplification of the process, but it continues to help me when writing gets hard, and when I start questioning *what* exactly I am writing about. It goes like this:

Writing is about two things. It's about clear seeing, and then it's about clear telling. 

It sounds so simple, doesn't it? Great advice often does. And yet I feel like there's a touch of transcendence to that sentence.

Do you have a pet? If you do, try and think of how you would describe them in a book. A loved one is fine, too. 

This is the kind of exercise that would often have me stumped; I would go and try and find books where similar characters were introduced, so that I could see how they were being described. If I was particularly uninspired, I would start describing them in excruciating physical detail, and bore everyone to death. 

But if you think of the above, it gets a lot easier. 

Clear *seeing* of my dog isn't just limited to how big its sweet brown eyes are. It's not just the muscle that poorly hides just under its coat of chocolate fur, either, although those are certainly a part of it. Clear seeing of my dog is also knowing that when I think of it, the first thing that comes to mind is an image of it running wildly towards me when I come back from work in a bad mood and open the front door. It drips drool all over the wooden floor, and some of that drool gets on the walls as its head swings sideways with excitement; but I don't even have time to chastise it for the mess before it reaches me and starts licking my hands, tapping its paws on the floor with poorly contained enthusiasm. It wants to jump up, hug me as well as it knows how to, rub itself against me, but it knows I'm wearing adulting clothes, not dog-petting clothes. It knows that it should wait until I get changed; but that doesn't stop it from saying hello.

To tell someone about something in a way that makes sense, you need to see clearly what it is that you want to tell them about. That takes courage. A dog is a harmless, kind thing, but other subjects require more out of you to look at them straight on. Tiptoeing around them is easier, but it makes for worse stories. People can't understand strife, pain, conflict, if you refuse to give it to them straight. The same goes for beauty, silliness, love, and other popular writing subjects. Even writing that description of my dog takes a modicum of courage; the honesty might make me sound silly, if I dwell on it for too long.

If you're willing to see clearly, and if what you're writing about is important enough to you that you can (for me, it usually only takes asking myself the question of how I see a certain thing for that image to pop up in my mind), all that's left is to put it down. That's the *clear telling* part, and this is when all those pesky considerations we'd swept under the rug come back. This is when we need to ask ourselves if that adverb is really necessary; if your reader really needs to know, or even cares about, what color is your dog's fur. This is the mechanistic part of writing, where grammar, flow, punctuation, and other boring words matter more than grandiose stuff like "truth". 

I think the two are equally important, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't fancy truth a bit more.
 
The world is filled with poor stories that fail at one of those two. But for me, and a lot of other aspiring writers - the kind that takes Creative Writing courses and has a larger book bill at the end of the month than they have for groceries - the part that fails the most often is the seeing. I used to get caught up in trying to describe things in a way that was interesting, trying to shape the stories into things that I thought people want to read. Nowadays, I think I can tell when a sentence sounds off, and I can even fix it, most of the time. It's knowing *what* to write that's hard. Knowing *what* you want to tell people. And for that, taking a moment to ask myself what it is that I *see* has been a game changer. Once you have that, it's just a matter of writing it down.

My conclusion, at least for now, is: tell them what you see. That has the highest possible chance of resonating with people, because it's the most truthful. Readers are smart. They can tell when you're lying to them, and they'll respect you for telling the truth. 

And even if it doesn't resonate with people, at least you put your vision out there. You told the truth, not what your logical brain thinks Stephen King's truth sounds like (three mentions in a single post? That must be a record).

## Current state of things

I've managed to finish the second chapter in the second draft. I'm moving slower than I expected, but I'm happier with the writing I'm producing than with what I'd produced so far, so I'm okay with that. Slow and steady wins the race, as they say.

**Current word count**: 60.000 words


**June goal**: 65.000 words on the second draft.
