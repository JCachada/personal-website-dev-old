description: "A short update on the wordcount and what to expect in April."

As outlined in the previous update, this will be a short one to keep most of my focus on the actual writing.

This month I reworked a very large part of the second chapter to better flesh out one of the main character arcs and move one big flashback sequence to where it made the most sense. These changes caused a lot of text to be rewritten (around 20.000 words of it) to make sure the arcs made more sense, but reflected in only a small increase in overall word count. 

During the month of April, you can expect a blog post as well (in addition to the normal update) outlining my thoughts on something I've been considering a lot during these rewrites. Without wanting to spoil too much, which is to say without wanting to say things before I fully consider them, it has to do with the notion of truthfulness and how it should influence one's writing voice.

## Current state of things

**Current word count**: 54.764
**April goal**: 65.000 words on the second draft.
