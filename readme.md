<h1>
  J. Cachada: Personal Website Made with Gatsby
</h1>

Hi! Welcome to my personal website. This is something I did for my own personal use and to learn how to work with some new technologies. I got started with [a gatsby starter, specifically the gatsby blog starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/). Everything else I did myself - I used no premade components and coded everything myself. I wanted to learn how to do these things, so I thought it'd be a fair tradeoff to have a slightly less fancy website but be able to say I made it myself.
Obviously, it is always iterative - I will come back to it and improve things for sure.

While I didn't use any pre-built components, I did use some plugins to make the experience smoother. Gatsby has a lot of good ones built-in, like the gatsby-image plugin to process image loading. Some other relevant ones are theme-UI for the theme cycling, gatsby-plugin-flexsearch for the search bar, and gatsby-plugin-glamor to be able to use css-in-js with server side static rendering of pages.

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or contact me directly on github. You are welcome to look at the source code and use any parts of the implementation you want to in your own projects. This project uses the MIT license, which is very permissive.

  To run the website

Clone the repository, and then run "gatsby develop" on the command line while on the repository's folder to play with the development version, or "gatsby build", then "gatsby serve -o" to see the production website.
